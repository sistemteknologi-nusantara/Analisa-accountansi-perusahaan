"""Market snapshot — frozen at PREDICTING → EVIDENCE transition.

Source of truth: ``infonet-economy/RULES_SKELETON.md`` §2.2 (snapshot
fields), §3.10 (snapshot_event_hash usage), §5.2 (when emitted).

The snapshot is the **commitment boundary** for all downstream
evaluation. Once frozen:

- Liquidity gates (``min_market_participants``,
  ``min_market_total_stake``) are evaluated against frozen values, not
  live state.
- Predictor exclusion is computed from ``frozen_predictor_ids``
  (UNION ``rotation_descendants`` at resolution time).
- Bootstrap PoW uses ``snapshot_event_hash`` as its salt so attackers
  can't pre-mine before the boundary.

The snapshot itself is **immutable** by spec — the producer emits it
once and never updates it. The first snapshot in canonical hashchain
append order is authoritative; a malformed first snapshot fails closed
and cannot be replaced by a later one.
